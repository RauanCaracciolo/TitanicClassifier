<h1>Titanic Machine Learning Projetct</h1>
<h4>This project aim to process the classic Titanic passangers to make it usable to Binary Classification models to evaluate and compare them.</h4>
<h2>Processing the data</h2>
<h4>First, we observe the bases datases in datasets/titanic_train and datasets/titanic_test.</h4>

<h5>First, we see that this dataset have many Data that its uselesss to our model, like:'PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket' and 'Cabin'. We need to remove them from the dataset before starting to train the model.</h5>
